### **Rationale for Key Design Decisions and Assumptions**

*   **Interpretation of Instructions:** The instructions present a contradiction: to remove all primary, foreign, and unique identifier fields from the Silver tables, but also to document table relationships using key fields. This logical data model resolves this by:
    1.  Strictly adhering to the rule of removing all `_id` and other identifier columns from the Silver layer table definitions as explicitly instructed.
    2.  Fulfilling the relationship documentation requirement by reproducing the conceptual relationship diagram provided in the input.
    3.  This design implies that while the physical Silver tables are stored without surrogate keys, the relational logic is handled entirely within the ETL/ELT processing layer (e.g., when transforming data from Bronze to Silver or building Gold layer models). The joins are performed in-memory during the pipeline run, and the resulting conformed tables are saved without the keys used to create them.

*   **Table Structure and Conformance:** The Silver layer tables are modeled based on the business-centric `Model Conceptua` entities (`Application`, `Applicant`, etc.) rather than a direct 1:1 mirror of the more granular `BigQuery Model Logical Bronze Layer` tables. This is a standard and best practice for a Silver layer, as its purpose is to consolidate, cleanse, and conform data into structures that are more intuitive for business analysis and reporting. For instance, attributes from various source tables are integrated into a more holistic `Si_Application` table. This process involves data type standardization, cleansing based on business rules, and enrichment.

*   **Audit and Error Data Management:** Two dedicated tables, `Si_Audit_Log` and `Si_Error_Log`, are included as a cornerstone of a robust and governable data platform.
    *   **`Si_Audit_Log`**: Provides a high-level execution summary for each pipeline run, tracking metadata like duration, status, and row counts. This is essential for operational monitoring, performance tuning, and demonstrating compliance.
    *   **`Si_Error_Log`**: Captures row-level data quality and validation failures identified during the transformation process. This allows for systematic data stewardship, debugging of data quality rules, and quantifying data issues without polluting the main business tables with bad data or error flags.

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   It is assumed that the ETL/ELT logic populating the Silver layer is responsible for joining the various Bronze tables (using their keys) to create these consolidated Silver tables.
    *   It is assumed that the `record_identifier` in the `Si_Error_Log` can be a generated hash of the source row's content to provide a unique reference to the problematic data without relying on a persistent ID in the Silver layer.
